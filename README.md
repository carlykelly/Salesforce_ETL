# Salesforce_ETL

The project in this repository is an assignment completed for The George Washington University Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp.

In `ETL_Project.ipynb` six tables containing information about bootcamp courses are extracted from MySQL. These tables are then transformed in Jupyter Notebook so they are in the proper from to be loaded into Salesforce. These tables are connected in Salesforce through master-detail relationships.
